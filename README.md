The files here are used to render a website displaying the ANONY-MED Framework, a toolbox for healthcare AI model development that aims to be privacy-preserving when using patient medical data.

The structure of this framework has been developed based on two other similar projects re another AI-based medical prognosis tool. You can find them [here](https://github.com/rianaminocher/stratifai-ethics-manual) and [here](https://github.com/gabrielepluktaite/validate-framework).
